The website design is simple looking with decent color choices. 
The challenges I faced while developing the website is that I was not familiar with ReactJs and that went the most energizing part of making this project.
At the same time this was an exciting experience as I got to learn something new. This definitely gave me idea to learn ReactJs in depth. 
After this project I got a new short term goal of learning ReactJs as it will enhance my skills and knowledge.
